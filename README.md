<h1 align="center">SQLite with Morfeusz2</h1>

This repository contains the complete source code for the 
[SQLite database engine](https://sqlite.org/) as of release **3.36.0**,
integrated with [Morfeusz2](http://morfeusz.sgjp.pl/en) inflectional analyser and generator
API, serving the role of a tokenizer extension for SQLite's [fts5](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html) module. 

<h2 align="center" style="color:red">This is not an official repository!</h2>

SQLite sources are managed using the
[Fossil](https://www.fossil-scm.org/), a distributed version control system
that was specifically designed and written to support SQLite development.
The repository is available [here](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline).
